Cover me up to hide your shame.
Don't worry, though.  I'll still be the [b]victor[/b].
You can't [s]win[/s].  This is [b]my [u]game[/u][/b].
I'm much [b]stronger[/b], [b]smarter[/b], and [b]quicker[/b].
I am the [i][u]medicine[/i][/u].
I am the [b]elixir[/b].

You are but a [b][color=#00b7ff]fly[/color][/b] in my [u][color=#ff6600]soup[/color][/u].
I threw away the whole bowl.
I'll bring every squad, army, and troop
You're the programmer.
I'm your infinite loop.

You think you did well?
I should give you a sticker!
You are not that which ails me.
For I am the elixir.
